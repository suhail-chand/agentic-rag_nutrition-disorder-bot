    "Here, we lay the groundwork for the AI Nutrition Disorder Specialist bot by meticulously parsing and preparing data from various nutritional disorder documents. We begin by importing the necessary libraries, followed by setting up configurations for OpenAI models. Next, we parse PDF content using LlamaParse to extract tables and validate parsed JSON objects. We then perform semantic chunking of text for structured retrieval, and generate hypothetical questions and metadata for these text chunks and tables. Finally, we store everything in ChromaDB, ensuring efficient retrieval and processing of relevant information for the bot's responses. This structured approach equips the AI with the ability to provide accurate and contextually relevant answers to user queries related to nutritional disorders."

Nutrition: General Considerations\\nnitrogen consumed.\\n\\nOf the 20 amino acids, 9 are essential amino acids (EAAs); they cannot be synthesized and must be\\nobtained from the diet. All people require 8 EAAs; infants also require histidine.\\n\\nThe weight-adjusted requirement for dietary protein correlates with growth rate, which decreases from\\ninfancy until adulthood. The daily dietary protein requirement decreases from 2.2 g/kg in 3-mo-old infants\\nto 1.2 g/kg in 5-yr-old children and to 0.8 g/kg in adults. Protein requirements correspond to EAA\\nrequirements (see\\nTable 1-2). Adults trying to increase muscle mass need very little extra protein beyond the requirements in\\nthe table.\\n\\nThe amino acid composition of protein varies widely. Biological value (BV) reflects the similarity in amino\\nacid composition of protein to that of animal tissues; thus, BV indicates what percentage of a dietary\\nprotein provides EAAs for the body. A perfect match is egg protein, with a value of 100. Animal proteins in\\nmilk and meat have a high BV (~90); proteins in cereal and vegetables have a lower BV (~40), and some\\nderived proteins (eg, gelatin) have a BV of 0. The extent to which dietary proteins supply each other's\\nmissing amino acids (complementarity) determines the overall BV of the diet. The recommended daily\\nallowances (RDA) for protein assumes that the average mixed diet has a BV of 70.\\n\\nFats: Fats are broken down into fatty acids and glycerol. Fats are required for tissue growth and hormone\\nproduction. Saturated fatty acids, common in animal fats, tend to be solid at room temperature. Except for\\npalm and coconut oils, fats derived from plants tend to be liquid at room temperature; these fats contain\\nhigh levels of monounsaturated fatty acids or polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs).\\n\\nPartial hydrogenation of unsaturated fatty acids (as occurs during food manufacturing) produces trans\\nfatty acids, which are solid or semisolid at room temperature. In the US, the main dietary source of trans\\nfatty acids is partially hydrogenated vegetable oils, used in manufacturing certain foods (eg, cookies,\\ncrackers, chips) to prolong shelf-life. Trans fatty acids may elevate LDL cholesterol and lower HDL; they\\nmay also independently increase the risk of coronary artery disease.\\n\\nEssential fatty acids (EFAs) are linoleic acid, an \\u03c9-6 (n-6) fatty acid, and linolenic acid, an \\u03c9-3 (n-3) fatty\\nacid. Other \\u03c9-6 acids (eg, arachidonic acid) and other \\u03c9-3 fatty acids (eg, eicosapentaenoic acid,\\ndocosahexaenoic acid) are required by the body but can be synthesized from EFAs.\\n\\nEFAs (see also p. 19) are needed for the formation of various eicosanoids (biologically active lipids),\\nincluding prostaglandins, thromboxanes, prostacyclins, and leukotrienes. Consumption of \\u03c9-3 fatty acids\\nmay decrease the risk of coronary artery disease.\\n\\n[Table 1-2.

Nutrition: General Considerations\\n\\nOf the 20 amino acids, 9 are essential amino acids (EAAs); they cannot be synthesized and must be obtained from the diet. All people require 8 EAAs; infants also require histidine.\\n\\nThe weight-adjusted requirement for dietary protein correlates with growth rate, which decreases from infancy until adulthood. The daily dietary protein requirement decreases from 2.2 g/kg in 3-mo-old infants to 1.2 g/kg in 5-yr-old children and to 0.8 g/kg in adults. Protein requirements correspond to EAA requirements (see Table 1-2).

Biological value (BV) reflects the similarity in amino acid composition of protein to that of animal tissues; thus, BV indicates what percentage of a dietary protein provides EAAs for the body. A perfect match is egg protein, with a value of 100. Animal proteins in milk and meat have a high BV (~90); proteins in cereal and vegetables have a lower BV (~40), and some derived proteins (eg, gelatin) have a BV of 0.

Fats are required for tissue growth and hormone production. Saturated fatty acids, common in animal fats, tend to be solid at room temperature. Except for palm and coconut oils, fats derived from plants tend to be liquid at room temperature; these fats contain high levels of monounsaturated fatty acids or polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs).\\n\\nPartial hydrogenation of unsaturated fatty acids (as occurs during food manufacturing) produces trans fatty acids, which are solid or semisolid at room temperature. In the US, the main dietary source of trans fatty acids is partially hydrogenated vegetable oils, used in manufacturing certain foods (eg, cookies, crackers, chips) to prolong shelf-life. Trans fatty acids may elevate LDL cholesterol and lower HDL; they may also independently increase the risk of coronary artery disease.\\n\\nEssential fatty acids (EFAs) are linoleic acid, an \\u03c9-6 (n-6) fatty acid, and linolenic acid, an \\u03c9-3 (n-3) fatty acid. Other \\u03c9-6 acids (eg, arachidonic acid) and other \\u03c9-3 fatty acids (eg, eicosapentaenoic acid, docosahexaenoic acid) are required by the body but can be synthesized from EFAs.\\n\\nEFAs (see also p. 19) are needed for the formation of various eicosanoids (biologically active lipids), including prostaglandins, thromboxanes, prostacyclins, and leukotrienes.

Recommended Dietary Reference Intakes* for Some Macronutrients, Food and Nutrition\\nBoard, Institute of Medicine of the National Academies]\\n\\nMicronutrients\\n\\nVitamins and minerals required in minute amounts (trace minerals) are micronutrients (see Chs. 4 and 5).\\n\\nWater-soluble vitamins are vitamin C (ascorbic acid) and 8 members of the vitamin B complex: biotin,\\nfolate, niacin, pantothenic acid, riboflavin (vitamin B2), thiamin (vitamin B1), vitamin B6 (pyridoxine), and\\nvitamin B12 (cobalamin).\\n\\nFat-soluble vitamins are vitamins A (retinol), D (cholecalciferol and ergocalciferol), E (\\u03b1-tocopherol), and\\nK (phylloquinone and menaquinone).\\n\\nOnly vitamins A, E, and B12 are stored to any significant extent in the body; the other vitamins must be\\nconsumed regularly to maintain tissue health.\\n\\nEssential trace minerals include chromium, copper, iodine, iron, manganese, molybdenum, selenium,\\nand zinc. Except for chromium, each of these is incorporated into enzymes or hormones required in\\nmetabolism. Except for deficiencies of iron and zinc, micromineral deficiencies are uncommon in\\ndeveloped countries (see Ch. 5).\\n\\nOther minerals (eg, aluminum, arsenic, boron, cobalt, fluoride, nickel, silicon, vanadium) have not been\\nproved essential for people. Fluoride, although not essential, helps prevent tooth decay by forming a\\ncompound with Ca (CaF2), which stabilizes the mineral matrix in teeth.\\n\\nAll trace minerals are toxic at high levels, and some (arsenic, nickel, and chromium) may cause cancer.\\n\\nOther Dietary Substances\\n\\nThe daily human diet typically contains as many as 100,000 chemicals (eg, coffee contains 1000). Of\\nthese, only 300 are nutrients, only some of which are essential. However, many nonnutrients in foods are\\nuseful. For example, food additives (eg, preservatives, emulsifiers, antioxidants, stabilizers) improve the\\nproduction and stability of foods. Trace components (eg, spices, flavors, odors, colors, phytochemicals,\\nmany other natural products) improve appearance and taste.\\n\\nFiber: Fiber occurs in various forms (eg, cellulose, hemicellulose, pectin, gums). It increases GI motility,\\nprevents constipation, and helps control diverticular disease. Fiber is thought to accelerate the elimination\\nof cancer-causing substances produced by bacteria in the large intestine. Epidemiologic evidence\\nsuggests an association between colon cancer and low fiber intake and a beneficial effect of fiber in\\npatients with functional bowel disorders, Crohn's disease, obesity, and hemorrhoids. Soluble fiber\\n(present in fruits, vegetables, oats, barley, and legumes) reduces the postprandial increase in blood\\nglucose and insulin and can reduce cholesterol levels.\\n\\nThe typical Western diet is low in fiber (about 12 g/day) because of a high intake of highly refined wheat\\nflour and a low intake of fruits and vegetables. Increasing fiber intake to about 30 g/day by consuming\\nmore vegetables, fruits, and high-fiber cereals and grains is generally recommended. However, very high\\nfiber intake may reduce absorption of certain minerals.\\n\\nNutritional Requirements\\n\\nGood nutrition aims to achieve and maintain a desirable body composition and high potential for physical\\nand mental work. Balancing energy intake with energy expenditure is necessary for a desirable body\\nweight. Energy expenditure depends on age, sex, weight (see Table 1-4), and metabolic and physical\\nactivity. If energy intake exceeds expenditure, weight is gained. Taking in about 100 calories/day more\\nthan needed results in a weight gain of about 4 to 5 kg in a year. If energy intake is less than expenditure,\\nweight is lost.\\n\\n                                                                                                             55\",\n",

Nutrition: General Considerations\\n\\nDaily dietary requirements for essential nutrients also depend on age, sex, weight, and metabolic and\\nphysical activity. Every 5 yr, the Food and Nutrition Board of the National Academy of Sciences/National\\nResearch Council and the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) issues the dietary reference intakes\\n(DRIs) for protein, energy, and some vitamins and minerals (see Tables 1-4,\\n4-1, and 5-2). For vitamins and minerals about which less is known, safe and adequate daily dietary\\nintakes are estimated.\\n\\nPregnant women (see p. 2608) and infants (see p. 2703) have special nutritional needs.\\n\\nThe USDA publishes the Food Guide Pyramid, which specifies the number of recommended daily\\nservings of various food groups. The recommendations are individualized based on age, sex, and\\nphysical activity (see\\nTable 1-5). Generally, the recommended intake decreases with aging because physical activity tends to\\ndecrease, resulting in less energy expended. The new Food Guide Pyramid emphasizes the following:\\n\\n\\u2022 Increasing consumption of whole grains\\n\\n\\u2022 Increasing consumption of vegetables and fruits\\n\\n\\u2022 Substituting fat-free or low-fat milk products (or equivalents) for whole-fat milk products\\n\\n\\u2022 Reducing consumption of saturated fats and trans fatty acids\\n\\n\\u2022 Exercising regularly\\n\\nAdequate fluid intake is also important.\\n\\nFats should constitute \\u2264 30% of total calories, and saturated and trans fatty acids should constitute <\\n10%. Excess intake of saturated fats contributes to atherosclerosis. Substituting polyunsaturated fatty\\nacids for saturated fats can decrease the risk of atherosclerosis. Routine use of nutritional supplements is\\nnot necessary or beneficial; some supplements can be harmful. For example, excess vitamin A can lead to\\nhypervitaminosis A, with headaches, osteoporosis, and rash.\\n\\nNutrition in Clinical Medicine\\n\\nNutritional deficiencies can often worsen health outcomes (whether a disorder is present or not), and\\nsome disorders (eg, malabsorption) can cause nutritional deficiencies. Also, many patients (eg, elderly\\npatients during acute hospitalization) have unsuspected nutritional deficiencies that require treatment.\\nMany medical centers have multi-disciplinary nutrition support teams of physicians, nurses, dietitians, and\\npharmacists to help the clinician prevent, diagnose, and treat occult nutritional deficiencies.\\n\\nOvernutrition may contribute to chronic disorders, such as cancer, hypertension, obesity, diabetes\\nmellitus, and coronary artery disease.

Nutrition: General Considerations\\nEvaluating general nutritional status includes history, physical examination, and sometimes tests. If\\nundernutrition is suspected, laboratory tests (eg, albumin levels) and skin tests for delayed\\nhypersensitivity may be done (see p.\\n13). Body composition analysis (eg, skinfold measurements, bioelectrical impedance analysis) is used to\\nestimate percentage of body fat and to evaluate obesity (see p. 58).\\n\\nHistory includes questions about dietary intake, weight change, and risk factors for nutritional deficiencies\\nand a focused review of systems (see\\nTable 2-1 on p. 11). A dietitian can obtain a more detailed dietary history. It usually includes a list of foods\\neaten within the previous 24 h and a food questionnaire. A food diary may be used to record all foods\\neaten. The weighed ad libitum diet, in which the patient weighs and writes down all foods consumed, is\\nthe most accurate record.\\n\\nA complete physical examination, including measurement of height and weight and distribution of body\\nfat, should be done. Body mass index (BMI)\\u2014weight(kg)/height(m)2, which adjusts weight for height (see\\nTable 6-2 on p. 59), is more accurate than height and weight tables. There are standards for growth and\\nweight gain in infants, children, and adolescents (see p. 2756).\\n\\nDistribution of body fat is important. Disproportionate truncal obesity (ie, waist/hip ratio > 0.8) is\\nassociated with cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disorders, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus more\\noften than fat located elsewhere. Measuring waist circumference in patients with a BMI of < 35 helps\\ndetermine whether they have truncal obesity and helps predict risk of diabetes, hypertension,\\nhypercholesterolemia, and cardiovascular disorders. Risk is increased if waist circumference is > 102 cm\\n(> 40 in) in men or > 88 cm (> 35 in) in women.\\n\\nNutrient-Drug Interactions\\n\\nNutrition can affect the body's response to drugs; conversely, drugs can affect the body's nutrition.\\n\\nFoods can enhance, delay, or decrease drug absorption. Foods impair absorption of many antibiotics.\\nThey can alter metabolism of drugs; eg, high-protein diets can accelerate metabolism of certain drugs by\\nstimulating cytochrome P-450. Eating grapefruit can inhibit cytochrome P-450 34A, slowing metabolism of\\nsome drugs (eg, amiodarone, carbamazepine, cyclosporine, certain Ca channel blockers). Diets that alter\\nthe bacterial flora may markedly affect the overall metabolism of certain drugs. Some foods affect the\\nbody's response to drugs. For example, tyramine, a component of cheese and a potent vasoconstrictor,\\ncan cause hypertensive crisis in some patients who take monoamine oxidase inhibitors and eat cheese.\\n\\nNutritional deficiencies can affect drug absorption and metabolism. Severe energy and protein\\ndeficiencies reduce enzyme tissue concentrations and may impair the response to drugs by reducing\\nabsorption or protein binding and causing liver dysfunction. Changes in the GI tract can impair absorption\\nand affect the response to a drug. Deficiency of Ca, Mg, or zinc may impair drug metabolism. Vitamin C\\ndeficiency decreases activity of drug-metabolizing enzymes, especially in the elderly.\\n\\nMany drugs affect appetite, food absorption, and tissue metabolism (see\\nTable 1-6). Some drugs (eg, metoclopramide) increase GI motility, decreasing food absorption. Other\\ndrugs (eg, opioids, anticholinergics) decrease GI motility. Some drugs are better tolerated if taken with\\nfood.\\n\\nCertain drugs affect mineral metabolism. For example, diuretics, especially thiazides, and corticosteroids\\ncan deplete body K, increasing susceptibility to digoxin-induced cardiac arrhythmias. Repeated use of\\nlaxatives may deplete K.

Undernutrition\\nof breastfeeding, which typically occurs when a younger sibling is born, displacing the older child from the\\nbreast. So children with kwashiorkor tend to be older than those with marasmus. Kwashiorkor may also\\nresult from an acute illness, often gastroenteritis or another infection (probably secondary to cytokine\\nrelease), in a child who already has PEU. A diet that is more deficient in protein than energy may be more\\nlikely to cause kwashiorkor than marasmus. Less common than marasmus, kwashiorkor tends to be\\nconfined to specific parts of the world, such as rural Africa, the Caribbean, and the Pacific islands. In\\nthese areas, staple foods (eg, yams, cassavas, sweet potatoes, green bananas) are low in protein and\\nhigh in carbohydrates. In kwashiorkor, cell membranes leak, causing extravasation of intravascular fluid\\nand protein, resulting in peripheral edema.\\n\\nStarvation is a complete lack of nutrients. It occasionally occurs when food is available (as in fasting or\\nanorexia nervosa) but usually occurs because food is unavailable (eg, during famine or wilderness\\nexposure).\\n\\nSecondary PEU: This type most commonly results from the following:\\n\\n\\u2022 Disorders that affect GI function: These disorders can interfere with digestion (eg, pancreatic\\n insufficiency), absorption (eg, enteritis, enteropathy), or lymphatic transport of nutrients (eg,\\n retroperitoneal fibrosis, Milroy's disease).\\n\\n\\u2022 Wasting disorders: In wasting disorders (eg, AIDS, cancer) and renal failure, catabolism causes cytokine\\n excess, resulting in undernutrition via anorexia and cachexia (wasting of muscle and fat). End-stage\\n heart failure can cause cardiac cachexia, a severe form of undernutrition; mortality rate is particularly\\n high.

If liquid oral supplements are used with solid food, they should be given at least 1 h before meals so that the amount of food eaten at the meal is not reduced.\\n\\nTreatment of institutionalized elderly patients with PEU requires multiple interventions:\\n\\n- Environmental measures (eg, making the dining area more attractive)\\n- Feeding assistance\\n- Changes in diet (eg, use of food enhancers and caloric supplements between meals)\\n- Treatment of depression and other underlying disorders\\n- Use of orexigenics, anabolic steroids, or both\\n\\nThe long-term use of gastrostomy tube feeding is essential for patients with severe dysphagia; its use in patients with dementia is controversial. Increasing evidence supports the avoidance of unpalatable therapeutic diets (eg, low salt, diabetic, low cholesterol) in institutionalized patients because these diets decrease food intake and may cause severe PEU.\\n\\n66\",\n",

Nutritional Support\\n\\u2022 Coma or depressed sensorium\\n\\n\\u2022 Liver failure\\n\\n\\u2022 Inability to take oral feedings due to head or neck trauma or neurologic disorders\\n\\n\\u2022 Critical illnesses (eg, burns) causing metabolic stress\\n\\nOther indications may include bowel preparation for surgery in seriously ill or undernourished patients,\\nclosure of enterocutaneous fistulas, and small-bowel adaptation after massive intestinal resection or in\\ndisorders that may cause malabsorption (eg, Crohn's disease).\\n\\nProcedure: If tube feeding is needed for \\u2264 4 to 6 wk, a small-caliber, soft nasogastric or nasoenteric (eg,\\nnasoduodenal) tube made of silicone or polyurethane is usually used. If a nasal injury or deformity makes\\nnasal placement difficult, an orogastric or other oroenteric tube can be placed.\\n\\nTube feeding for > 4 to 6 wk usually requires a gastrostomy or jejunostomy tube, placed endoscopically,\\nsurgically, or radiologically. Choice depends on physician capabilities and patient preference.\\n\\nJejunostomy tubes are useful for patients with contraindications to gastrostomy (eg, gastrectomy, bowel\\nobstruction proximal to the jejunum). However, these tubes do not pose less risk of tracheobronchial\\naspiration than gastrostomy tubes, as is often thought. Jejunostomy tubes are easily dislodged and are\\nusually used only for inpatients.\\n\\nFeeding tubes are surgically placed if endoscopic and radiologic placement is unavailable, technically\\nimpossible, or unsafe (eg, because of overlying bowel). Open or laparoscopic techniques can be used.\\n\\nFormulas: Liquid formulas commonly used include feeding modules and polymeric or other specialized\\nformulas.\\n\\nFeeding modules are commercially available products that contain a single nutrient, such as proteins,\\nfats, or carbohydrates. Feeding modules may be used individually to treat a specific deficiency or\\ncombined with other formulas to completely satisfy nutritional requirements.\\n\\nPolymeric formulas (including blenderized food and milk-based or lactose-free commercial formulas)\\nare commercially available and generally provide a complete, balanced diet. For oral or tube feedings,\\nthey are usually preferred to feeding modules. In hospitalized patients, lactose-free formulas are the most\\ncommonly used polymeric formulas. However, milk-based formulas tend to taste better than lactose-free\\nformulas.

Nutritional Support\\nresuming TPN via the central venous catheter.\\n\\nHepatic complications include liver dysfunction, painful hepatomegaly, and hyperammonemia. They can\\ndevelop at any age but are most common among infants, particularly premature ones (whose liver is\\nimmature).\\n\\n\\u2022 Liver dysfunction may be transient, evidenced by increased transaminases, bilirubin, and alkaline\\n phosphatase; it commonly occurs when TPN is started. Delayed or persistent elevations may result\\n from excess amino acids. Pathogenesis is unknown, but cholestasis and inflammation may contribute.\\n Progressive fibrosis occasionally develops. Reducing protein delivery may help.\\n\\n\\u2022 Painful hepatomegaly suggests fat accumulation; carbohydrate delivery should be reduced.\\n\\n\\u2022 Hyperammonemia can develop in infants, causing lethargy, twitching, and generalized seizures. Arginine\\n supplementation at 0.5 to 1.0 mmol/kg/day can correct it.\\n\\nIf infants develop any hepatic complication, limiting amino acids to 1.0 g/kg/day may be necessary.\\n\\nAbnormalities of serum electrolytes and minerals should be corrected by modifying subsequent\\ninfusions or, if correction is urgently required, by beginning appropriate peripheral vein infusions. Vitamin\\nand mineral deficiencies are rare when solutions are given correctly. Elevated BUN may reflect\\ndehydration, which can be corrected by giving free water as 5% dextrose via a peripheral vein.\\n\\nVolume overload (suggested by > 1 kg/day weight gain) may occur when patients have high daily\\nenergy requirements and thus require large fluid volumes.\\n\\nMetabolic bone disease, or bone demineralization (osteoporosis or osteomalacia), develops in some\\npatients given TPN for > 3 mo. The mechanism is unknown. Advanced disease can cause severe\\nperiarticular, lower-extremity, and back pain. Temporarily or permanently stopping TPN is the only known\\ntreatment.\\n\\nAdverse reactions to lipid emulsions (eg, dyspnea, cutaneous allergic reactions, nausea, headache,\\nback pain, sweating, dizziness) are uncommon but may occur early, particularly if lipids are given at > 1.0\\nkcal/kg/h. Temporary hyperlipidemia may occur, particularly in patients with kidney or liver failure;\\ntreatment is usually not required. Delayed adverse reactions to lipid emulsions include hepatomegaly, mild\\nelevation of liver enzymes, splenomegaly, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and, especially in premature\\ninfants with respiratory distress syndrome, pulmonary function abnormalities. Temporarily or permanently\\nslowing or stopping lipid emulsion infusion may prevent or minimize these adverse reactions.\\n\\nGallbladder complications include cholelithiasis, gallbladder sludge, and cholecystitis. These\\ncomplications can be caused or worsened by prolonged gallbladder stasis. Stimulating contraction by\\nproviding about 20 to 30% of calories as fat and stopping glucose infusion several hours a day is helpful.\\nOral or enteral intake also helps. Treatment with metronidazole, ursodeoxycholic acid, phenobarbital, or\\ncholecystokinin helps some patients with cholestasis.\\n\\nNutritional Support for Dying or Severely Demented Patients\\n\\nAnorexia or loss of appetite is common among dying patients (see p. 3485). Behavioral measures (eg,\\nusing flexible feeding schedules, feeding slowly, giving small portions or favorite or strongly flavored\\nfoods) can often increase oral intake.

Liver stores provide only a several-month supply.\\n\\nAlcohol interferes with folate absorption, metabolism, renal excretion, and enterohepatic reabsorption, as well as intake. 5-Fluorouracil, metformin, methotrexate, phenobarbital, phenytoin, sulfasalazine, triamterene, and trimethoprim impair folate metabolism.\\n\\nIn the US, many dietary staples (eg, cereals, grain products) are routinely enriched with folate, tending to reduce risk of deficiency.\\n\\n# Symptoms and Signs\\n\\nFolate deficiency may cause glossitis, diarrhea, depression, and confusion. Anemia may develop insidiously and, because of compensatory mechanisms, be more severe than symptoms suggest.\\n\\nFolate deficiency during pregnancy increases the risk of fetal neural tube defects and perhaps other brain defects (see p. 2992).\\n\\n# Diagnosis\\n\\n- CBC and serum vitamin B12 and folate levels\\n\\nCBC may indicate megaloblastic anemia indistinguishable from that of vitamin B12 deficiency. If serum folate is &#x3C; 3 \\u03bcg/L or ng/mL (&#x3C; 7 nmol/L), deficiency is likely. Serum folate reflects folate status unless intake has recently increased or decreased. If intake has changed, erythrocyte (RBC) folate level better reflects tissue stores. A level of &#x3C; 140 \\u03bcg/L or ng/mL (&#x3C; 305 nmol/L) indicates inadequate status. Also, an increase in the homocysteine level suggests tissue folate deficiency (but the level is also affected by\\n\\n\",\n",

The chance of severe flushing can be reduced by starting immediate-release niacin at a low dose\\n(eg, 50 mg tid) and increasing it very slowly. At intermediate doses (1000 mg/day), triglyceride levels\\ndecrease 15 to 20%, and HDL cholesterol levels increase 15 to 30%. Reductions in LDL cholesterol are\\nmodest (< 10%).

Vitamin Deficiency, Dependency & Toxicity\\n\\nSecondary vitamin A deficiency may be due to decreased bioavailability of provitamin A carotenoids or to\\ninterference with absorption, storage, or transport of vitamin A. Interference with absorption or storage is\\nlikely in sprue, cystic fibrosis, pancreatic insufficiency, duodenal bypass, chronic diarrhea, bile duct\\nobstruction, giardiasis, and cirrhosis. Vitamin A deficiency is common in prolonged protein-energy\\nundernutrition not only because the diet is deficient but also because vitamin A storage and transport is\\ndefective. In children with complicated measles, vitamin A can shorten the duration of the disorder and\\nreduce the severity of symptoms and risk of death.\\n\\nSymptoms and Signs\\n\\nImpaired dark adaptation of the eyes, which can lead to night blindness, is an early symptom.\\nXerophthalmia (which is nearly pathognomonic) results from keratinization of the eyes. It involves drying\\n(xerosis) and thickening of the conjunctivae and corneas. Superficial foamy patches composed of\\nepithelial debris and secretions on the exposed bulbar conjunctiva (Bitot's spots) develop. In advanced\\ndeficiency, the cornea becomes hazy and can develop erosions, which can lead to its destruction\\n(keratomalacia).\\n\\nKeratinization of the skin and of the mucous membranes in the respiratory, GI, and urinary tracts can\\noccur.

The same doses are\\nrecommended for infants and children with complicated measles. Infants born of HIV-positive mothers\\nshould receive 50,000 IU (15,000 RAE) within 48 h of birth. Prolonged daily administration of large doses,\\nespecially to infants, must be avoided because toxicity may result.\\n\\nFor pregnant or breastfeeding women, prophylactic or therapeutic doses should not exceed 10,000 IU\\n(3000 RAE)/day to avoid possible damage to the fetus or infant.\\n\\nVitamin A Toxicity\\n\\nVitamin A toxicity can be acute (usually due to accidental ingestion by children) or chronic. Both\\ntypes usually cause headache and increased intracranial pressure. Acute toxicity also causes\\nnausea and vomiting. Chronic toxicity also causes changes in skin, hair, and nails; abnormal\\nliver test results; and, in a fetus, birth defects. Diagnosis is usually clinical. Unless birth defects\\nare present, adjusting the dose almost always leads to complete recovery.\\n\\nAcute vitamin A toxicity in children may result from taking large doses (> 100,000 RAE [> 300,000 IU]),\\nusually accidentally. In adults, acute toxicity has occurred when arctic explorers ingested polar bear or\\nseal livers, which contain several million units of vitamin A.\\n\\nChronic toxicity in older children and adults usually develops after doses of > 30,000 RAE (> 100,000\\nIU)/day have been taken for months. Megavitamin therapy is a possible cause, as are massive daily\\ndoses (50,000 to 120,000 RAE [150,000 to 350,000 IU]) of vitamin A or its metabolites, which are\\nsometimes given for nodular acne or other skin disorders. Adults who consume > 1500 RAE (> 4500\\nIU)/day of vitamin A may develop osteoporosis. Infants who are given excessive doses (6,000 to 20,000\\nRAE [18,000 to 60,000 IU]/day) of water-miscible vitamin A may develop toxicity within a few weeks. Birth\\ndefects occur in children of women receiving isotretinoin (which is related to vitamin A) for acne treatment\\nduring pregnancy.\\n\\nAlthough carotene is converted to vitamin A in the body, excessive ingestion of carotene causes\\ncarotenemia, not vitamin A toxicity. Carotenemia is usually asymptomatic but may lead to carotenodermia,\\nin which the skin becomes yellow. When taken as a supplement, \\u03b2-carotene has been associated with\\nincreased cancer risk; risk does not seem to increase when carotenoids are consumed in fruits and\\nvegetables.\\n\\nSymptoms and Signs\\n\\nAlthough symptoms may vary, headache and rash usually develop during acute or chronic toxicity. Acute\\ntoxicity causes increased intracranial pressure. Drowsiness, irritability, abdominal pain, nausea, and\\nvomiting are common. Sometimes the skin subsequently peels.\\n\\nEarly symptoms of chronic toxicity are sparsely distributed, coarse hair; alopecia of the eyebrows; dry,\\nrough skin; dry eyes; and cracked lips. Later, severe headache, pseudotumor cerebri, and generalized\\nweakness develop. Cortical hyperostosis of bone and arthralgia may occur, especially in children.\\nFractures may occur easily, especially in the elderly. In children, toxicity can cause pruritus, anorexia, and\\nfailure to thrive. Hepatomegaly and splenomegaly may occur.\\n\\nIn carotenodermia, the skin (but not the sclera) becomes deep yellow, especially on the palms and soles.\\n\\nDiagnosis\\n\\n\\u2022 Clinical evaluation\\n\\nDiagnosis is clinical.

Vitamin Deficiency, Dependency & Toxicity\\n\\nDifferentiating vitamin A toxicity from other disorders may be difficult. Carotenodermia may also occur in\\nsevere hypothyroidism and anorexia nervosa, possibly because carotene is converted to vitamin A more\\nslowly.\\n\\nPrognosis\\n\\nComplete recovery usually occurs if vitamin A ingestion stops. Symptoms and signs of chronic toxicity\\nusually disappear within 1 to 4 wk. However, birth defects in the fetus of a mother who has taken\\nmegadoses of vitamin A are not reversible.\\n\\nTreatment\\n\\nVitamin A is stopped.\\n\\nVitamin B6\\n\\nVitamin B6 includes a group of closely related compounds: pyridoxine, pyridoxal, and pyridoxamine. They\\nare metabolized in the body to pyridoxal phosphate, which acts as a coenzyme in many important\\nreactions in blood, CNS, and skin metabolism. Vitamin B6 is important in heme and nucleic acid\\nbiosynthesis and in lipid, carbohydrate, and amino acid metabolism.\\n\\nVitamin B6 Deficiency and Dependency\\n\\nBecause vitamin B6 is present in most foods, dietary deficiency is rare. Secondary deficiency\\nmay result from various conditions. Symptoms can include peripheral neuropathy, a pellagra-\\nlike syndrome, anemia, and seizures, which, particularly in infants, may not resolve when\\ntreated with anticonvulsants. Impaired metabolism (dependency) is rare; it causes various\\nsymptoms, including seizures, intellectual disability, and anemia. Diagnosis is usually clinical;\\nno laboratory test readily assesses vitamin B6 status. Treatment consists of giving oral vitamin\\nB6 and, when possible, treating the cause.\\n\\nDietary deficiency, though rare, can develop because extensive processing can deplete foods of vitamin\\nB6. Secondary deficiency most often results from protein-energy undernutrition, malabsorption,\\nalcoholism, use of pyridoxine-inactivating drugs (eg, anticonvulsants, isoniazid, cycloserine, hydralazine,\\ncorticosteroids, penicillamine), or excessive loss. Rarely, it results from increased metabolic demand (eg,\\nin hyperthyroidism).\\n\\nRare inborn errors of metabolism can affect pyridoxine metabolism.\\n\\nThe role of vitamin B6 deficiency in increasing plasma homocysteine levels and in contributing to vascular\\ndisorders is under study.\\n\\nSymptoms and Signs\\n\\nDeficiency causes a pellagra-like syndrome, with seborrheic dermatitis, glossitis, and cheilosis, and, in\\nadults, can cause depression, confusion, EEG abnormalities, and seizures. Rarely, deficiency or\\ndependency causes seizures in infants. Seizures, particularly in infants, may be refractory to treatment\\nwith anticonvulsants. Normocytic, microcytic, or sideroblastic anemia can also develop.\\n\\nDiagnosis\\n\\n\\u2022 Clinical evaluation\\n\\nVitamin B6 deficiency should be considered in any infant who has seizures, any patient who has seizures\\nrefractory to treatment with anticonvulsants, and any patient with deficiencies of other B vitamins,\\n\\n                                                                                                           85\",\n",

Symptoms can include peripheral neuropathy, a pellagra-like syndrome, anemia, and seizures, which, particularly in infants, may not resolve when treated with anticonvulsants. Impaired metabolism (dependency) is rare; it causes various symptoms, including seizures, intellectual disability, and anemia. Diagnosis is usually clinical; no laboratory test readily assesses vitamin B6 status. Treatment consists of giving oral vitamin B6 and, when possible, treating the cause.\\n\\nDietary deficiency, though rare, can develop because extensive processing can deplete foods of vitamin B6. Secondary deficiency most often results from protein-energy undernutrition, malabsorption, alcoholism, use of pyridoxine-inactivating drugs (eg, anticonvulsants, isoniazid, cycloserine, hydralazine, corticosteroids, penicillamine), or excessive loss. Rarely, it results from increased metabolic demand (eg, in hyperthyroidism).\\n\\nRare inborn errors of metabolism can affect pyridoxine metabolism.\\n\\nThe role of vitamin B6 deficiency in increasing plasma homocysteine levels and in contributing to vascular disorders is under study.\\n\\n# Symptoms and Signs\\n\\nDeficiency causes a pellagra-like syndrome, with seborrheic dermatitis, glossitis, and cheilosis, and, in adults, can cause depression, confusion, EEG abnormalities, and seizures. Rarely, deficiency or dependency causes seizures in infants. Seizures, particularly in infants, may be refractory to treatment with anticonvulsants. Normocytic, microcytic, or sideroblastic anemia can also develop.\\n\\n# Diagnosis\\n\\n- Clinical evaluation\\n\\nVitamin B6 deficiency should be considered in any infant who has seizures, any patient who has seizures refractory to treatment with anticonvulsants, and any patient with deficiencies of other B vitamins.\\n\\n85\",\n",

Breastfed babies of vegan\\nmothers may develop vitamin B12 deficiency by age 4 to 6 mo because their\\n\\n[\\nTable 4-5. Causes of Vitamin B12 Deficiency]\\n\\nliver stores (which are normally extensive) are limited and their rapid growth rate results in high demand.\\n\\nVitamin B12 deficiency usually results from inadequate absorption (see Table 4-5 and p. 153), which, in\\nthe elderly, most commonly results from decreased acid secretion. In such cases, crystalline vitamin B12\\n(such as that available in vitamin supplements) can be absorbed, but food-bound vitamin B12 is not\\nliberated and absorbed normally. Inadequate absorption may occur in blind loop syndrome (with\\novergrowth of bacteria) or fish tapeworm infestation; in these cases, bacteria or parasites use ingested\\nvitamin B12 so that less is available for absorption. Vitamin B12 absorption may be inadequate if ileal\\nabsorptive sites are destroyed by inflammatory bowel disease or are surgically removed. Less common\\ncauses of inadequate vitamin B12 absorption include chronic pancreatitis, gastric surgery, malabsorption\\nsyndromes, AIDS, use of certain drugs (eg, antacids, metformin), repeated exposure to nitrous oxide, and\\na genetic disorder causing malabsorption in the ileum (Imerslund-Graesbeck syndrome).\\n\\nPernicious anemia is often used synonymously with vitamin B12 deficiency. However, pernicious\\nanemia specifically refers to anemia resulting from vitamin B12 deficiency caused by an autoimmune\\nmetaplastic atrophic gastritis with loss of intrinsic factor (see p. 133). Patients with classic pernicious\\nanemia, most commonly younger adults, are at increased risk of stomach and other GI cancers.\\n\\nSubacute combined degeneration refers to degenerative changes in the nervous system due to\\nvitamin B12 deficiency; they affect mostly brain and spinal cord white matter. Demyelinating or axonal\\nperipheral neuropathies can occur.\\n\\nSymptoms and Signs\\n\\nAnemia usually develops insidiously. It is often more severe than its symptoms indicate because its slow\\nevolution allows physiologic adaptation. Occasionally, splenomegaly and hepatomegaly occur. Various GI\\nsymptoms, including weight loss and poorly localized abdominal pain, may occur. Glossitis, usually\\ndescribed as burning of the tongue, is uncommon.\\n\\nNeurologic symptoms develop independently from and often without hematologic abnormalities. In early\\nstages, decreased position and vibratory sensation in the extremities is accompanied by mild to moderate\\nweakness and hyporeflexia. In later stages, spasticity, extensor plantar responses, greater loss of position\\nand vibratory sensation in the lower extremities, and ataxia emerge. These deficits may develop in a\\nstocking-glove distribution. Tactile, pain, and temperature sensations are usually spared but may be\\ndifficult to assess in the elderly.\\n\\nSome patients are also irritable and mildly depressed. Paranoia (megaloblastic madness), delirium,\\nconfusion, spastic ataxia, and, at times, postural hypotension may occur in advanced cases. The\\nconfusion may be difficult to differentiate from age-related dementias, such as Alzheimer's disease.\\n\\nDiagnosis\\n\\n\\u2022 CBC and vitamin B12 and folate levels\\n\\n\\u2022 Sometimes methylmalonic acid levels or Schilling test\\n\\n                                                                                                           87\",\n",

      "            \"text\": \"The Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 4. Vitamin Deficiency, Dependency & Toxicity\\nDiagnosis is based on CBC and vitamin B12 and folate levels. It is important to remember that severe\\nneurologic disease may occur without anemia or macrocytosis.\\n\\nCBC detects megaloblastic anemia. Tissue deficiency and macrocytic indexes may precede the\\ndevelopment of anemia. A vitamin B12 level < 200 pg/mL (< 145 pmol/L) indicates vitamin B12 deficiency.\\nThe folate level is measured because vitamin B12 deficiency must be differentiated from folate deficiency\\nas a cause of megaloblastic anemia; folate supplementation can mask vitamin B12 deficiency and may\\nalleviate megaloblastic anemia but allow the neurologic deficits to progress or even accelerate.\\n\\nWhen clinical judgment suggests vitamin B12 deficiency but the vitamin B12 level is low-normal (200 to\\n350 pg/mL [145 to 260 pmol/L]) or hematologic indexes are normal, other tests can be done. Measuring\\nserum methylmalonic acid (MMA) levels may be useful. An elevated MMA level supports vitamin B12\\ndeficiency but may be due to renal failure. MMA levels can also be used to monitor the response to\\ntreatment. MMA levels remain normal in folate deficiency; homocysteine levels may be elevated with\\neither vitamin B12 or folate deficiency. Less commonly, holotranscobalamin II (transcobalamin II-B12\\ncomplex) content is measured; when holotranscobalamin II is < 40 pg/mL (< 30 pmol/L), vitamin B12 is\\ndeficient.\\n\\nAfter deficiency is diagnosed, additional tests may be indicated for younger adults but usually not for the\\nelderly. Unless dietary vitamin B12 is obviously inadequate, measurement of serum gastrin levels or\\nautoantibodies to intrinsic factor may be done; sensitivity and specificity of these tests may be poor.\\n\\nSchilling test: The Schilling test is useful only if diagnosing intrinsic factor deficiency is important, as in\\nclassic pernicious anemia. This test is not necessary for most elderly patients. The Schilling test\\nmeasures absorption of free radiolabeled vitamin B12. Radiolabeled vitamin B12 is given orally, followed\\nin 1 to 6 h by 1000 \\u03bcg (1 mg) of parenteral vitamin B12, which reduces uptake of radiolabeled vitamin\\nB12 by the liver. Absorbed radiolabeled vitamin B12 is excreted in urine, which is collected for 24 h. The\\namount excreted is measured, and the percentage of total radiolabeled vitamin B12 is determined. If\\nabsorption is normal, \\u2265 9% of the dose given appears in the urine. Reduced urinary excretion (< 5% if\\nkidney function is normal) indicates inadequate vitamin B12 absorption. Improved absorption with the\\nsubsequent addition of intrinsic factor to radiolabeled vitamin B12 confirms the diagnosis of pernicious\\nanemia.

Laboratory confirmation may be available. Anemia is common. Bleeding, coagulation, and PT\\nare normal.\\n\\nSkeletal x-rays can help diagnose childhood (but not adult) scurvy.

Levels of < 0.6 mg/dL (< 34 \\u03bcmol/L) are considered marginal; levels of < 0.2 mg/dL (< 11 \\u03bcmol/L)\\nindicate vitamin C deficiency. Measurement of ascorbic acid levels in the WBC-platelet layer of\\ncentrifuged blood is not widely available or standardized.\\n\\nIn adults, scurvy must be differentiated from arthritis, hemorrhagic disorders, gingivitis, and protein-energy\\nundernutrition. Hyperkeratotic hair follicles with surrounding hyperemia or hemorrhage are almost\\npathognomonic. Bleeding gums, conjunctival hemorrhages, most petechiae, and ecchymoses are\\nnonspecific.\\n\\nTreatment\\n\\n\\u2022 Nutritious diet with supplemental ascorbic acid\\n\\nFor scurvy in adults, ascorbic acid 100 to 500 mg po tid is given for 1 to 2 wk, until signs disappear, and\\nfollowed by a nutritious diet supplying 1 to 2 times the daily recommended intake. In scurvy, therapeutic\\ndoses of ascorbic acid restore the functions of vitamin C in a few days. The symptoms and signs usually\\ndisappear over 1 to 2 wk. Chronic gingivitis with extensive subcutaneous hemorrhage persists longer.\\n\\nPrevention\\n\\nVitamin C 75 mg po once/day for women and 90 mg po once/day for men prevents deficiency. Smokers\\nshould consume an additional 35 mg/day. Five servings of most fruits and vegetables (recommended\\ndaily) provide > 200 mg of vitamin C.\\n\\nVitamin C Toxicity\\n\\nThe upper limit for vitamin C intake is 2000 mg/day. Up to 10 g/day of vitamin C are sometimes taken for\\nunproven health benefits, such as preventing or shortening the duration of viral infections or slowing or\\nreversing the progression of cancer or atherosclerosis. Such doses may acidify the urine, cause nausea\\nand diarrhea, interfere with the healthy antioxidant-prooxidant balance in the body, and, in patients with\\nthalassemia or hemochromatosis, promote iron overload. Intake below the upper limit does not have toxic\\neffects in healthy adults.\\n\\nVitamin D\\n\\nVitamin D has 2 main forms: D2 (ergocalciferol) and D3 (cholecalciferol); the latter is the naturally\\noccurring form and the form used for low-dose supplementation. Vitamin D3 is synthesized in skin by\\nexposure to direct sunlight (ultraviolet B radiation) and obtained in the diet chiefly in fish liver oils and salt\\nwater fish. In some developed countries, milk and other foods are fortified with vitamin D.

Vitamin Deficiency, Dependency & Toxicity\\n\\nVitamin D is a prohormone with several active metabolites that act as hormones. Vitamin D is metabolized\\nby the liver to 25(OH)D, which is then converted by the kidneys to 1,25(OH)2D (1,25-\\ndihydroxycholecalciferol, calcitriol, or active vitamin D hormone). 25(OH)D, the major circulating form, has\\nsome metabolic activity, but 1,25(OH)2D is the most metabolically active. The conversion to 1,25(OH)2D\\nis regulated by its own concentration, parathyroid hormone (PTH), and serum concentrations of Ca and\\nphosphate.\\n\\n[\\nTable 4-6.

Vitamin Deficiency, Dependency & Toxicity\\nline of calcification appears at the epiphysis, becoming denser and thicker as calcification proceeds.\\nLater, the bone matrix becomes calcified and opacified at the subperiosteal level.\\n\\nIn adults, bone demineralization, particularly in the spine, pelvis, and lower extremities, can be seen on x-\\nrays; the fibrous lamellae can also be seen, and incomplete ribbonlike areas of demineralization\\n(pseudofractures, Looser's lines, Milkman's syndrome) appear in the cortex.\\n\\nBecause levels of serum 25(OH)D reflect body stores of vitamin D and correlate with symptoms and signs\\nof vitamin D deficiency better than levels of other vitamin D metabolites, 25(OH)D (D2+D3) measurement\\nis generally considered the best way to diagnose deficiency. Goal 25(OH)D levels are 30 to 40 ng/mL\\n(about 75 to 100 nmol/L); whether higher levels may be beneficial remains uncertain.\\n\\nIf the diagnosis is unclear, serum levels of 1,25(OH)2D and urinary Ca concentration can be measured. In\\nsevere deficiency, serum 1,25(OH)2D is abnormally low, usually undetectable. Urinary Ca is low in all\\nforms of the deficiency except those associated with acidosis.\\n\\nIn vitamin D deficiency, serum Ca may be low or, because of secondary hyperparathyroidism, may be\\nnormal. Serum phosphate usually decreases, and serum alkaline phosphatase usually increases. Serum\\nPTH is elevated.\\n\\nType I hereditary vitamin D-dependent rickets results in normal serum 25(OH)D, low serum 1,25(OH)2D\\nand Ca, and normal or low serum phosphate.\\n\\nTreatment\\n\\n\\u2022 Correction of Ca and phosphate deficiencies\\n\\n\\u2022 Supplemental vitamin D\\n\\nCa deficiency (which is common) and phosphate deficiency should be corrected.

Affected premature neonates have muscle weakness.\\n\\nIn children, chronic cholestatic hepatobiliary disease or cystic fibrosis causes neurologic deficits, including spinocerebellar ataxia with loss of deep tendon reflexes, truncal and limb ataxia, loss of vibration and position senses, ophthalmoplegia, muscle weakness, ptosis, and dysarthria.\\n\\nIn adults with malabsorption, vitamin E deficiency very rarely causes spinocerebellar ataxia because adults have large vitamin E stores in adipose tissue.\\n\\n# Diagnosis\\n\\n- Low \\u03b1-tocopherol level or low ratio of serum \\u03b1-tocopherol to serum lipids\\n\\nWithout a history of inadequate intake or a predisposing condition, vitamin E deficiency is unlikely. Confirmation usually requires measuring the vitamin level. Measuring RBC hemolysis in response to peroxide can suggest the diagnosis but is nonspecific. Hemolysis increases as vitamin E deficiency impairs RBC stability.\\n\\nMeasuring the serum \\u03b1-tocopherol level is the most direct method of diagnosis. In adults, vitamin E deficiency is suggested if the \\u03b1-tocopherol level is &#x3C; 5 \\u03bcg/mL (&#x3C; 11.6 \\u03bcmol/L). Because abnormal lipid levels can affect vitamin E status, a low ratio of serum \\u03b1-tocopherol to lipids (&#x3C; 0.8 mg/g total lipid) is the most accurate indicator in adults with hyperlipidemia.\\n\\nIn children and adults with abetalipoproteinemia, serum \\u03b1-tocopherol levels are usually undetectable.\\n\\n95\",\n",

Four (Na, K, Ca, and Mg) are cations; two (Cl\\nand P) are accompanying anions (see p. 820). Daily requirements range from 0.3 to 2.0 g. Bone, muscle,\\nheart, and brain function depend on these minerals.\\n\\nNine trace minerals (microminerals) are required by people in minute amounts: chromium, copper, iodine,\\niron, fluorine, manganese, molybdenum, selenium, and zinc. (For sources, functions, effects of deficiency\\nand toxicity, and dietary requirements, see\\nTables 5-1 and\\n5-2.) All trace minerals are toxic at high levels; some minerals (arsenic, nickel, and chromium) may be\\ncarcinogens.\\n\\nMineral deficiencies (except of iodine, iron, and zinc) do not often develop spontaneously in adults on\\nordinary diets; infants are more vulnerable because their growth is rapid and intake varies. Trace mineral\\nimbalances can result from hereditary disorders (eg, hemochromatosis, Wilson's disease), kidney dialysis,\\nparenteral nutrition, or restrictive diets prescribed for people with inborn errors of metabolism.\\n\\nChromium\\n\\nOnly 1 to 3% of biologically active trivalent chromium (Cr) is absorbed. Normal plasma levels are 0.05 to\\n0.50 \\u03bcg/L (1.0 to 9.6 nmol/L). Chromium potentiates insulin activity and increases the growth rate in\\nundernourished children. Supplements do not enhance muscle size or strength in men.\\n\\nDeficiency: Four patients receiving long-term TPN developed possible chromium deficiency, with\\nglucose intolerance, weight loss, ataxia, and peripheral neuropathy. Symptoms resolved in 3 who were\\ngiven trivalent chromium 150 to 250 mg.\\n\\nToxicity: High doses of trivalent chromium given parenterally cause skin irritation, but lower doses given\\norally are not toxic. Exposure to hexavalent chromium (CrO3) in the workplace may irritate the skin, lungs,\\nand GI tract and may cause perforation of the nasal septum and lung carcinoma.\\n\\nCopper\\n\\nCopper is a component of many body proteins; almost all of the body's copper is bound to copper\\nproteins. Unbound (free) copper ions are toxic. Genetic mechanisms control the incorporation of copper\\ninto apoproteins and the processes that prevent toxic accumulation of copper in the body. Copper\\nabsorbed in excess of metabolic requirements is excreted through bile.\\n\\n[Table 5-1. Trace Minerals]\\n\\nAcquired Copper Deficiency\\n\\nIf the genetic mechanisms controlling copper metabolism are normal, dietary deficiency rarely causes\\nclinically significant copper deficiency. The only reported causes are kwashiorkor, persistent infantile\\ndiarrhea (usually associated with a diet limited to milk), severe malabsorption (as in sprue), and excessive\\nzinc intake.\\n\\nDeficiency may cause neutropenia, impaired bone calcification, and hypochromic anemia not responsive\\nto iron supplements.\\n\\nDiagnosis is based on low serum levels of copper and ceruloplasmin, although these tests are not always\\nreliable. Treatment is directed at the cause, and copper 1.5 to 3 mg/day po (usually as copper sulfate) is\\ngiven.\\n\\n                                                                                                          99\",\n",

Symptoms resolved in 3 who were given trivalent chromium 150 to 250 mg.\\n\\n# Toxicity\\n\\nHigh doses of trivalent chromium given parenterally cause skin irritation, but lower doses given orally are not toxic. Exposure to hexavalent chromium (CrO3) in the workplace may irritate the skin, lungs, and GI tract and may cause perforation of the nasal septum and lung carcinoma.\\n\\n# Copper\\n\\nCopper is a component of many body proteins; almost all of the body's copper is bound to copper proteins. Unbound (free) copper ions are toxic. Genetic mechanisms control the incorporation of copper into apoproteins and the processes that prevent toxic accumulation of copper in the body. Copper absorbed in excess of metabolic requirements is excreted through bile.\\n\\n# Acquired Copper Deficiency\\n\\nIf the genetic mechanisms controlling copper metabolism are normal, dietary deficiency rarely causes clinically significant copper deficiency. The only reported causes are kwashiorkor, persistent infantile diarrhea (usually associated with a diet limited to milk), severe malabsorption (as in sprue), and excessive zinc intake.\\n\\nDeficiency may cause neutropenia, impaired bone calcification, and hypochromic anemia not responsive to iron supplements.\\n\\nDiagnosis is based on low serum levels of copper and ceruloplasmin, although these tests are not always reliable. Treatment is directed at the cause, and copper 1.5 to 3 mg/day po (usually as copper sulfate) is given.\\n\\n\",\n",

Mineral Deficiency & Toxicity\\n\\u2022 Supportive measures\\n\\nFor copper toxicity due to ingesting grams of copper, prompt gastric lavage is done. Copper toxicity that\\ncauses complications such as hemolytic anemia, anuria, or hepatotoxicity is also treated with either oral\\npenicillamine 250 mg q 6 h to 750 mg q 12 h (1000 to 1500 mg/day in 2 to 4 doses) or dimercaprol 3 to 5\\nmg/kg IM q 4 h for 2 days, then q 4 to 6 h (see also\\nTable 340-4 and copper salts in\\nTable 340-8). If used early, hemodialysis may be effective. Occasionally, copper toxicity is fatal despite\\ntreatment.\\n\\nInherited Copper Toxicity\\n\\n(Wilson's Disease)\\n\\nInherited copper toxicity results in accumulation of copper in the liver and other organs. Hepatic\\nor neurologic symptoms develop. Diagnosis is based on a low serum ceruloplasmin level, high\\nurinary excretion of copper, and sometimes liver biopsy results. Treatment consists of a low-\\ncopper diet and chelation, usually with penicillamine or dimercaprol.\\n\\nWilson's disease is a progressive disorder of copper metabolism that affects 1 person in 30,000. Affected\\npeople are homozygous for the mutant recessive gene, located on chromosome 13. Heterozygous\\ncarriers, who constitute about 1.1% of the population, are asymptomatic.\\n\\nPathophysiology\\n\\nThe genetic defect impairs copper transport. The impaired transport decreases copper secretion into the\\nbile, thus causing the copper overload and resultant accumulation in the liver, which begins at birth. The\\nimpaired transport also interferes with incorporation of copper into the copper protein ceruloplasmin, thus\\ndecreasing serum levels of ceruloplasmin.\\n\\nHepatic fibrosis develops, ultimately causing cirrhosis.

Younger children are given 10 mg/kg bid or 6.7 mg/kg tid (20 mg/kg/d) po. Pyridoxine 25 mg\\npo once/day is given with penicillamine. Occasionally, use of penicillamine is associated with worsening\\nneurologic symptoms.\\n\\nTrientine hydrochloride is an alternative treatment to penicillamine. Doses are 375 to 750 mg po bid or\\n250 to 500 mg po tid (750 to 1500 mg/day).\\n\\nZinc acetate 50 mg po tid can prevent reaccumulation of copper in patients who cannot tolerate\\npenicillamine or trientine or who have neurologic symptoms that do not respond to the other drugs.\\n(CAUTION: Penicillamine or trientine must not be given with zinc because either drug can bind zinc,\\nforming a compound with no therapeutic effect.)\\n\\nPoor long-term adherence to drug therapy is common. After 1 to 5 yr of therapy, lower dose maintenance\\ndrug therapy can be considered. Regular follow-up care with an expert in liver disease is recommended.\\n\\nLiver transplantation may be lifesaving for patients who have Wilson's disease and fulminant hepatic\\nfailure or severe hepatic insufficiency refractory to drugs.\\n\\nFluorine\\n\\nMost of the body's fluorine (F) is contained in bones and teeth. Fluoride (the ionic form of fluorine) is\\nwidely distributed in nature. The main source of fluoride is fluoridated drinking water.\\n\\nDeficiency: Fluorine deficiency can lead to dental caries and possibly osteoporosis. Fluoridation of\\nwater that contains < 1 ppm (the ideal) reduces the incidence of dental caries. If a child's drinking water is\\nnot fluoridated, oral fluoride supplements can be prescribed.\\n\\nToxicity: Excess fluorine can accumulate in teeth and bones, causing fluorosis. Drinking water\\ncontaining > 10 ppm is a common cause. Permanent teeth that develop during high fluoride intake are\\nmost likely to be affected. Exposure must be much greater to affect deciduous teeth.\\n\\nThe earliest signs are chalky white, irregularly distributed patches on the surface of the enamel; these\\npatches become stained yellow or brown, producing a characteristic mottled appearance. Severe toxicity\\nweakens the enamel, pitting its surface. Bony changes, including osteosclerosis, exostoses of the spine,\\nand genu valgum, can develop but only in adults after prolonged high intake of fluoride.\\n\\nNo tests to diagnose toxicity are available.\\n\\nTreatment involves reducing fluoride intake; eg, in areas with high fluoride water levels, patients should\\nnot drink fluoridated water or take fluoride supplements.

Mineral Deficiency & Toxicity\\n\\nZinc deficiency in children causes impaired growth and impaired taste (hypogeusia).

In children or adults, symptoms\\ninclude hypogonadism, alopecia, impaired immunity, anorexia, dermatitis, night blindness, anemia,\\nlethargy, and impaired wound healing.\\n\\nZinc deficiency should be suspected in undernourished patients with typical symptoms or signs. However,\\nbecause many of the symptoms and signs are nonspecific, clinical diagnosis of mild zinc deficiency is\\ndifficult. Laboratory diagnosis is also difficult. Low albumin levels, common in zinc deficiency, make serum\\nzinc levels difficult to interpret; diagnosis usually requires the combination of low levels of zinc in serum\\nand increased urinary zinc excretion. If available, isotope studies can measure zinc status more\\naccurately.\\n\\nTreatment consists of elemental zinc 15 to 120 mg/day po until symptoms and signs resolve.\\n\\nAcrodermatitis enteropathica (a rare, once fatal autosomal recessive disorder) causes malabsorption\\nof zinc. Psoriasiform dermatitis develops around the eyes, nose, and mouth; on the buttocks; and in an\\nacral distribution. The disorder also causes hair loss, paronychia, impaired immunity, recurrent infection,\\nimpaired growth, and diarrhea. Symptoms and signs usually develop after infants are weaned from breast\\nmilk. In such cases, doctors suspect the diagnosis. If deficiency is diagnosed, zinc sulfate 30 to 150\\nmg/day po usually results in complete remission.\\n\\nToxicity: The recommended upper limit for zinc intake is 40 mg/day. Toxicity is rare. Ingesting doses of\\nelemental zinc ranging from 100 to 150 mg/day for prolonged periods interferes with copper metabolism\\nand causes low blood copper levels, RBC microcytosis, neutropenia, and impaired immunity; higher\\ndoses should be given only for short periods of time and the patient should be followed closely. Ingesting\\nlarger amounts (200 to 800 mg/day), usually by consuming acidic food or drink from a galvanized (zinc-\\ncoated) container, can cause anorexia, vomiting, and diarrhea.
